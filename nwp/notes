more efficient -- establish the nodes and edges only once, only update properties (aice) each time step

Reference:
USCG Healy
maximum speed = 31 km/h
cruising      = 26 km/h
1.4 m ice     =  5.6 km/h

At cruising speed, 2965 km = 114 hours; about 5 days vs. the 10 of CAFS model lead time

# RG: RTOFS: auxiliary file with lats, lons wrapped in to range
# RG: RTOFS: auxiliary file with tmask, tarea for rtofs grid(s)
# RG: RTOFS, UFS: tripolar grid means adjacent geographic points aren't always i,j adjacent
# RG: RTOFS: a guess about the archipelago seam

# RG: CAFS: is baffin bay insize cafs domain?
# RG: CAFS: Need a findij function (65.68 N, -168.59), (64.0, -78.0) 
# RG: CAFS: Rtofs does this more elegantly, using masked arrays.
